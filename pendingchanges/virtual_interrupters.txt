Improvements:
    The NullInterrupter is now a virtual base class to help reduce compile-time
    instantiation cost.

Houdini:
    A new HoudiniInterrupter has been added that derives from the
    NullInterrupter and the Interrupter is now deprecated. All the SOPs have
    been updated to use the new HoudiniInterrupter.
