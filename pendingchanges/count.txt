    New features:
    - Added tools::countActiveVoxels() for multi-threaded counting of active voxels, optionally by bounding box. The Tree::activeVoxelCount() method now uses this implementation.
    - Added tools::memUsage() for multi-threaded counting of bytes of memory used. The Tree::memUsage() method now uses this implementation.

    API changes:
    - tools::countActiveValues() has now been deprecated in favor of the new tools::countActiveVoxels() method.
    - RootNode::onVoxelCount() and InternalNode::onVoxelCount() have now been deprecated. These methods were previously only called by Tree::activeVoxelCount(). It is recommended to use the tools::DepthFirstNodeVisitor with a custom operator for any other use cases.
