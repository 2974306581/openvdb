    Build:
    - Dependency on OpenEXR's Half implementation has been removed from the
      core library by naturalizing the implementation into openvdb::math.
      This is fully bitwise compatible, but may require switching Half
      references to math::Half.
    - The openvdb::tools::Film class no longer has a saveExr method in
      any build configuration.  Sample code for saving exrs from this
      object can be found in the command line render tool.
