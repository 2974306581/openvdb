Build:
  - The Windows defines NOMINMAX and _USE_MATH_DEFINES are now provided in Platform.h.
  - Moved the logic from PlatformConfig.h into Platform.h.
  - The version.h header is now an auto generated header (version.h.in) populated by CMake.
    The OpenVDB Version and ABI defines are computed from the installation settings.
    Importantly, the value of OPENVDB_ABI_VERSION_NUMBER now always matches the version
    used at build time.
  - Added OPENVDB_USE_HALF, OPENVDB_USE_BLOSC and OPENVDB_USE_ZLIB as publicly available
    defines in version.h. These will be defined depending on the settings used to build
    OpenVDB.
